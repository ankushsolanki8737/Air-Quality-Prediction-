 Air Quality Prediction (AQI)

This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using a Linear Regression model in Python. The dataset contains information about dates, countries, air quality status, and AQI values. The data is preprocessed by converting the date into numeric format and encoding categorical values like country and status. After preprocessing, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, and a Linear Regression model is trained on the data. The model is then used to predict AQI values, which are compared with the actual values. The performance of the model is evaluated using RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Finally, the results are visualized using a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the actual and predicted AQI values. This project demonstrates a simple approach to AQI prediction and provides a baseline that can be further improved with more features and advanced machine learning techniques.
