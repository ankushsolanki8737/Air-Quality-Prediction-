# Air-Quality-Prediction-
Air Quality Prediction System using AQI dataset to analyze and predict pollution levels.

This project is about predicting **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using dataset values like date, country, and AQI levels.  

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Timeline
- **Week 1** â†’ Dataset search, problem definition, preprocessing  
- **Week 2** â†’ Model selection (Linear Regression), implementation, evaluation  

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- Input: Date, AQI values (and optionally pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, SO2, etc.)  
- Target: AQI Value  

ðŸ“Œ Make sure your CSV file (`data.csv`) is in the same folder as `air_quality.py`.
